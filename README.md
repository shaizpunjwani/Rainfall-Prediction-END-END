we have deployed our mahine learning model.

As the project is about the rainfall prediction in australia. We have got set of features we did our data analysis through this we achived some important insights.
The we performed our feature engineering where we dealt with the nan values, most importantly outliers and dealt categorical variables by encoding. 
We also applied the log normal distribution to standardize our continuous features.

As we have got alot of features so we did feature selection to select only those features which were very important.

We used RandomForest classifier and we achived 83 percent accuracy and most importantly we dealt with data leakage as well.
We also analyzed our predictions using appropriate metrics.

We also tried the artifical neuron network (ANN) where we achived 79 percent accuracy.
